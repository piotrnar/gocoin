Gocoin
==============
Gocoin is a full bitcoin client solution (node + wallet) written in Go language (golang). 


Architecture
--------------
The two basic components of the software are:
* client – a bitcoin node that must be connected to Internet
* wallet – a wallet app, that is designed to be used (for security) on a network-free PC

There are also some additional tools, from which the most useful one seems to be “versigmsg”, that verifies messages signed with bitcoin keys.


Main features
--------------
* Deterministic, cold wallet that is based on a seed-password (does not require any backups).
* Fast and easy switching between different wallets.
* Support for a bandwidth limit used by the node, configured separately for upload and download.
* Block database is compressed on your disk (it takes almost 30% less space).
* Optimized network latency and bandwidth usage.


Limitations of the client node
--------------
* No minig API
* No UPnP
* No IPv6
* No GUI window


System Requirements
==============
The online client node has much higher system requirements than the wallet app.


Client / Node
--------------
As for the current bitcoin block chain (aroung block #250000), it is recommended to have at least 4GB of RAM. Because of the required memory space, the node will likely crash on a 32-bit system, so build it using 64-bit Go compiler. For testnet-only purposes 32-bit arch is enough.

The entire block chain is stored in one large file, so your file system must support files larger than 4GB.


Wallet
--------------
The wallet application has very little requirements and it should work with literally any platform where you have a working Go compiler. That includes ARM (i.e. for Raspberry Pi).


Security
--------------
The wallet uses unencrypted files to store the private keys, so make sure that these files are stored on an encrypted disk, with a solid (unbreakable) password. Also use an encrypted swap file since there is no guarantee that no secret part wwould end up in the swap file, at some point. 

It is also extremely importnant (for the security of your wallet's private keys) to run the wallet app on a platform (OS) that has a reliable (menaing: unpredicible) random number generator. Any popular OS (Widnows, Linux, MacOS) should be fine, but be careful using any kind of a simplified hardware/OS. Read more about this:
 * http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/#pkg-variables 
 * https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=271486.0 

Deterministic nature of the wallet implies that whenever any of your private keys is compromised, it also compromises all the further keys that originate from it. To address this risk Type-3 deterministic wallet has been implemented in Gocoin version 0.6.4 (use -t3 command line switch). 

Dependencies
==============

You should have Git and Mercurial installed in your OS, so „git” ang „hg” cound be executed from a command prompt, without a need to specify a full path to the executables.

If you are on Windows and you want to get adventage od EC_Verify wrapper, you will also need MinGW(64) and MSys.

Of course you also need a Go compiler for your platform.

When you have all of the above, just allow Go to fetch the a dependency library for you, by executing:

	go get code.google.com/p/go.crypto/ripemd160



Building
==============
For anyone familiar with Go language, building should not be a problem. If you have Git installed, the simplest way to fetch the source code is by executing:

	go get github.com/piotrnar/gocoin

After you have the sources in your local disk, building them is usually as simple as executing "go build", in either the “client” or the “wallet” directory.


EC_Verify wrappers
--------------
Elliptic Curve math operations provided by standard Go libraries are very slow, comparing to other available solutions, therefore it is strongly  recommended to use one of the available cgo wrappers, whenever possible.

In order to use a cgo wrapper, copy either "openssl.go" or "sipasec.go" (but never both of them) from “client/speedup/” to the “client/” folder and redo “go build” there.  Unfortunately in practice it does not always go so smoothly.

To build a cgo wrapper on Windows, you will need MSys and MinGW (actually mingw64 for 64-bit Windows).

### sipasec
The "sipasec" option is 5 to 10 times faster from the "openssl", and something like 100 times faster from using no wrapper at all. To build this wrapper, follow the instructions in "cgo/sipasec/README.md". It has been proven working on Windows 7 and Linux (both 64 bit arch).

### openssl
If you fail to build "sipasec", you can try the "openssl" wrapper. On Linux, the OpenSSL option should build smoothly, as long as you have libssl-dev installed. On Windows, you will need libcrypto.a build for your architecture and the header files. Having the libcrypto.a, you will need to "fix" it by executing  bash script “win_fix_libcrypto.sh”.


Bootstrapping
==============
Gocoin's client node has not been really optimized for the initial chain download, but even if it was, this is still a very time consuming operation. Waiting for the entire chain to be fetched from the network and verified can be enough of a pain to discourage you from seeing how good gocoin is while working with an already synchronized chain.


Import block from Satoshi client
--------------
When you run the client node for the first time, it will look of the satoshi's blocks database in its default location (e.g. ~/.bitcoin/blocks or %appdata%\Bitcoin\blocks) and if found, it will ask you whether you want to import these blocks – you should say 'yes'. Choosing to verify the scripts is not neccessary, since it is very time consuming and all the blocks in the input database should only contain verified scripts anyway.

There is also a separate tool called „importblocks” that you can use for importing blocks from the satoshi's database into gocoin. Start the tool without parameters and it will tell you how to use it. While importing the blockchain using this tool, make sure that your node is not running.

In b oth cases, the oparation might take up to an hour, but it is one time only.


Fetching blockchain from local host
--------------
When starting the client, use command line switch „-c=<addr>” to instruct your node to connect to a host of your choice. For the time of the the chain download do not limit do download, nor upload speed.


User Manual
==============
Both the applications (client and wallet) are console only (no GUI window). The client node has a quite functional web interface though, which can be used to control it with your web browser, even from a remote PC (if you've allowed a remote access first).


Client / Node
--------------
Run “client -h” to see all available command line switches. The main ones are:

	-t - use Testnet (instead of regular bitcoin network)
	-ul=NN - set maximum upload speed to NN kilobytes per second
	-dl=NN - set maximum download speed to NN kilobytes per second

### Text UI
When the client is already running you have the UI where you can issue commands. Type "help" to see  the possible commands.

### Web UI
There is also a web interface that you can operate with a web browser. 

Make sure that wherever you launch the client executable from, there is the „webht” and „webui” folder, along with its content. They are an important part of the WebUI application. You can edit these files to satisfy your preferences.

By default, for security reasons, WebUI is available only from a local host, via http://127.0.0.1:8833/

If you want to have access to it from different computers:
 * Save the config file (gocoin.conf), using either TextUI command „configsave” or the „Show Configuaration” -> „Apply & Save” buttons, at the Home tab of the WebUI.
 * Change „Interface” value in the config file to „:8833”
 * Change „AllowedIP” value to allow access from all the addresses you need (i.e. „127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16”)
 * Remember to save the new config and then restart your node.

### Incoming connections
There is no UPnP support, so if you want to accept incoming connections, make sure to setup your NAT for routing TCP port 8333 (or 18333 for testnet) to the PC running the node.

It is possible to setup a different incoming port („TCPPort” config value), but currently the satoshi clients refuse to conenct using non-default ports, so if you get any incoming connections on non-default ports, they will only be from alternative clients, which there are barely few out there.


Wallet
--------------
Run “wallet -h” to see all available command line switches.


### Setup your seed
Wallet is deterministic and the only thing you need to setup it is the seed password. As long as you remember the password, you do not need to backup the wallet ever.

You can either enter this password each  time  when  running  the  wallet  (not advised since characters are shown on the screen) - or you can store  it,  once and for all, in a file called .secret


### Export public addresses
After you setup your wallet in a secured environment, you should export its public addresses. In order to to this, just run:

	wallet -l

The wallet's public addresses will be written to wallet.txt. Now you can take this file safely to your client's PC and place it in the folder where it looks for wallet.txt (the path is printed when starting the client). Execute “wal” from the UI to reload the wallet.

### Security precautions
Make sure that the disk with .secret file is encrypted.

Keep in mind that .secret should not contain any special characters, nor new line characters, because they count while calculating the seed. You do not see such characters on screen, so you may have problems re-creating the same file after you would loose it.

### Importing other private keys
You can import keys from your existing bitcoin wallet, as well as keys generated by other tools (all kind of key/address generators).

The key that you want to import must be in base58 encoded format, which looks somehow like this:
 * 5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS

To export a private key from the official bitcoin wallet use “dumprivkey” RPC command.

It import the key, just store the base58 encoded value in a file named .others - each key must be in a separate line.

You can also place a key's label in each line, after a space.

The imported keys will extend the key pool of the deterministic ones (that come from your password-seed). Afetr Importing each new key, you should redo “wallet -l” to get an updated wallet.txt for your client.


Spending money
--------------
Spending money is a secured process that requires several steps and moving files between your online client PC and your  offline wallet machine. USB flash disk is probably the most convenient medium to use for this purpose.

Never move any files others than the ones that you actually need to move, which are:
 * The “balance/” folder containing your unspent outputs – you move it from client to wallet
 * Text files with signed transactions – these you move from wallet to client

Assuming that you would not sign a wrong transaction, nothing in the files you move between the two points is security sensitive, so  you do not  need to worry about protecting the medium (USB disk).

### Export your balance from online node
From the moment when wallet.txt is properly loaded into your client, you can check your balance using the UI:

	bal

Each time you execute “bal”, a directory "balance/" is (re)created, in the folder where you run your client from.


#### Download balance using WebUI
Alternatively, you can also use the WebUI to download balance.zip file, which contains the balance folder.


### Sing your transaction by the wallet
To spend your money, move the most recent "balance/" folder, from the client to the PC with your wallet.

Now, on the wallet PC, when you execute “wallet” without any parameters, it should show you how much BTC you are able to spend, from the current balance.

To spend your coins, order the wallet to make and sign a new transaction, using a command like:

	wallet -send 1JbdKe4eBwtexisGTbCKY5v5CfphtdZXJs=0.01

Please note no spaces between the address, the equal sign and the value. The value represents the amount in BTC, which you request to send to the given address.

There are also other switches which you may find useful at this stage (i.e. a fee control). To see all your options, just run “wallet -h”.

#### Coin control
You can choose which coins you want to spend, by editing the file "balance/unspent.txt", before ordering the wallet to make a transaction.

Each line in that file represents an unspent output.

Whichever output you remove from “unspent.txt” will not be spent.

Whatever will be spent, will be taken in the order that appears in this file.

Any change will go back to the address from your first input, unless you use “-change” parameter.

### Signed transaction file
If everything goes well with the "-send …" order, the wallet creates a text file with a signed transaction. The file is named like 01234567.txt – this is the file you need to move to your online node in order to notify the network about your payment.

### Load transaction to your node
Move the signed transaction file to your online PC and use the node's text UI to execute:

	tx 01234567.txt

… where 01234567.txt is the path to your transaction file.

The node will decode the transaction and display it's details (inputs, outputs, fee, TXID).

#### Load transaction using WebUI
Alternatively, you can use WebUI and it's “Upload Transaction File” option, in the Transactions tab.
After you  load the transaction, its details will be shown in your browser - then you can use the envelope icon with a green arrow to broadcast it to the network, or the red X to unload it.
Coming back to Transactions tab later, press the button in the “Accepted transactions” row, to see all the transactions you've loaded (those with a red background are yours).


### Verify transaction carefully
Verify that the information shown on the screen (after loading it) matches exactly what you intended to spend.

If what you see would not be what you wanted, do not broadcast the transaction, but immediately restart the node (to unload the transaction) and destroy the transaction file, so you would not broadcast it accidentally in a future.

If you follow this simple rule, you should be able to keep you money safe, even in case if there was a critical bug in the wallet application that would destroy your coins (which we hope there isn't). But also (more likely) it allows you to double check that you did not make any mistake when making your transaction, giving you the last chance to fix it.

### Broadcast your transaction
After making sure that the transaction does indeed what you  intended, you must broadcast it to the network, in order to actually move your coins.

To broadcast your transaction, use “stx” command with the transaction ID as its parameter (you had the ID printed, when loading it).

Please note that the client does not broadcast transactions unrequested, so if your transaction does not appear in the chain soon enough, you may want  to repeat the "stx" command. There may of course be other reasons why your transaction does not get confirmed (i.e. the fee was to low), in which case repeating "stx ..." will not help much.

There is also a command to re-broadcast all the transaction that have been loaded, but not yet confirmed by the network:

	stxa



Known issues
==============

Possible UTXO db inconsistency
--------------
Sometimes when you kill a client node (instead of quiting it gracefully), it might happen that the unspent outputs database will get corrupt. In that case, when you start it the next time, the node will malfunction (i.e. panic or do not process any new blocks).

To fix this issue you need to rebuild the unspent database. In order to do this, start the client with „-r” switch.

The UTXO rebuild operation might take around an hour though, so for such cases, it is worth to have a backup of some recent version of this database. Then you don't need to rebuild it all, but only the part that came after your backup.
What you need to backup is the entire folder named „unspent3”, in gocoin's data folder. After you had recovered a backup, do not use “-r” switch.

Moreover during the rescan it seems to require much more system memory in peaks, so if you have like 4GB, your swap file might be getting a bit hot.


WebUI browser compatibility
--------------
The WebUI is being developed and tested with Chrome. As for other browsers some functions might not work.


Go's memory manager
--------------
It is a known issue that the current memory manager used by Go never releases a mem back to the OS, after allocating it once. Thus, as long as a node is running you will notice decreases in „Heap Size”, but never in „SysMem Used”. Untill this issue is fixed by Go developers, the only way to free the unused memory back to the system is by restarting the node. There are opinions (from go devels) that this is an issue only on Windows, but to be honest, I have tested gocoin with Linux as well and it seems to be quite the same there.
