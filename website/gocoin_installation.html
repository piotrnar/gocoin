<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>System requirements</h2>

<h3>client</h3>
If you want to run the full node (<b>client</b>), your system ought to have <u>at least 15GB of RAM</u>.<br>
<br>
To run the <b>client</b> you also need 64-bit OS and a file system that support files larger than 4GB (e.g NTFS or ext2/ext3/ext4).<br>
<br>
Note that you can purge blocks from disk, allowing you to run the node with a limited storage (e.g. 20GB).<br>
See <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> values:
<span class="cfg_name">Memory.MaxDataFileMB</span> and <span class="cfg_name">Memory.DataFilesKeep</span> (set this one to non-zero, e.g. 10)<br>
<br>
It runs very well on Linux based virtual servers - some of them you can rent per-hour:<br>

<h3>wallet</h3>
If you only want to use the <b>wallet</b> with the corresponding <b>balio</b> tool, you don't have to worry about
the system memory or a file system.<br>
It will run even on RaspberryPi.
<br><br>
<h2>Build from source</h2>

You will need <b>git</b> and <b>go</b> commands installed in your system and in most cases
(not for Windows) also <b>gcc</b> (e.g. <code>sudo apt-get install gcc</code>)<br>
<br>
Once you are ready with that, simply execute:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go get github.com/piotrnar/gocoin</code><br>
<br>
The process is also described in the main <b>README.md</b> file of the github repo

<h2>Binaries</h2>
The binaries (usually not the latest version) for Windows and Linux can be downloaded from
