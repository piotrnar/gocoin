<b>Gocoin 1.11.0 has been released.</b><br>
<br>
A big part of the codebase was hugely reworked.<br>
The client should perform significantly better, comparing to the previous 1.10.x versions.<br>
With a fast internet connection, you should observe an improvement in the initial chain sync time.<br>
Also the memory pool management performs better now, although this is rather hard to observe.<br>
