<h1>About Gocoin</h1>
<b>Gocoin</b> is a full <b>Bitcoin</b> solution, written entirely from scratch in <a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go language</a> (golang).<br>
The initial version was released in 2013 and it has been actively maintained ever since.<br>
<br>
The software's architecture is focused on high security and maximum performance.<br>
Unlike the architecture chosen by Bitcoin Core,
Gocoin's full node (called <b>client</b>) is an application independent from the <b>wallet</b>.<br>
<br>
The entire software was created and has been maintained by <a href="https://github.com/piotrnar" target="_blank">Piotr Narewski</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Client</h2>

It implements full bitcoin node functionality, including the network communication and the memory pool.<br>
The user interface is controlled via HTTP and a web browser, allowing a smooth remote access.<br>
It implements all the up-to-date consensus rules, including Taproot.<br>
It is capable of mining, although no proper mining API is currently provided, for the lack of interest.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wallet</h2>
The <b>wallet</b> is deterministic and password seeded. As long as you remember the password, you do not need any backups of your wallet.
For maximum security, it is designed to be used on an offline computer.
The recent versions are also compatible with BIP-39, allowing it to be used interchangeably with all the popular software and hardware wallets.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tools</h2>
In addition there is also a set of more and less useful tools. They are all inside the <b>tools/</b> folder. 
Each sub-directory in that folder is a separate tool.<br>
