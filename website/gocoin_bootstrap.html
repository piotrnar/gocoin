<h1>Bootstraping</h1>
Since Gocoin's client is a so-called <i>full node</i>,&nbsp;the initial block chain synchronization is quite a time consuming operation.<br>
<br>
With a good internet connection you may speed up the process quite much by starting the client with <code>-v -trust -nowallet</code> switches.<br>
<br>
Switch <code>-v</code> causes the node to only maintain UTXO database in memory.
It writes the content of the database to disk when you are shutting down the client properly.
<br>
<br>
Switch <code>-trust</code> makes the node to treat each new downloaded block as trusted, thus not verifying the scripts inside its transactions.
After syncing your chain with this switch on, it is important to check the hash of the last received block (e.g. comparing it with a value from a trusted block explorer).
<br>
<br>
Switch <code>-nowallet</code> disables wallet functionality which speeds up block processing. It also limit the memory used the node.
