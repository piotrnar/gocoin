<h1>Tweaks</h1>
On this page you can find ways to improve performance and lower resource consumptions of a running <b>client</b>.<br>
Like with every tuning, you should apply any changes in steps, checking each time for expected gains.<br>
In particular, you should monitor your system for RAM usage.
If it uses all the memory, revert the change before you see the swap file burning.<br>
<br>

<a name="gc"></a>
<h2>Garbage Collector and UTXO heap</h2>
If you have RAM to spare, try increasing the Garbage Collector treshold.<br>
This will increase memory usage, but should improve performance
(e.g. initial blockchain download time).<br>
For that, edit the <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> to set
<code>Memory.GCPercTrshold</code> to <b>100</b> or more (higher value for more effect).<br>
<br>
Alternativelly, you can turn off the GC treshold (by setting it to <b>-1</b>) and control
the maximum memory usage via <code>Memory.MemoryLimitMB</code>.<br>
Use this method if you want to allocate a fixed amount of RAM for your running node,
but mind that the limiter does not account for UTXO records when <code>Memory.UseGoHeap</code> is disabled.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you can switch UTXO records to Go's heap manager by setting <code>Memory.UseGoHeap</code>
to <b>true</b>.<br>
This seems to significantly improve UTXO update performance (so also chain sync times),
as long as your node does not run GC too often.<br>
At the other hand, your node will then need more memory and loading of UTXO database (when node starts)
will take slightly longer.<br>
<br>

<a name="cache"></a>
<h2>Initial chain sync cache</h2>

If you have a fast internet connection (e.g. 1Gbit), examine the two options below.<br>
Don't bother with a slow connection, as the download speed is your bottleneck then.
(you know it when syncing node uses your entire bandwidth)<br>
The first option will likely have a better effect on the performance, although requires more RAM.<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Turn off caching on disk.</b> Edit the <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> and set the value of <code>Memory.CacheOnDisk</code> to <b>false</b>.</li>
<li><b>Increase cache size.</b> Edit the <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> and increase the value of <code>Memory.SyncCacheSize</code>.</li>
</ol>
With a fast network connection, the bottleneck is the speed at which your node builds the UTXO database.<br>
To assure the UTXO worker doesn't have to wait for the network,
the node tries to download blocks ahead and store them in the cache.<br>
The bigger the cache, the less likely it is that the UTXO worker will ever have to wait for the network.<br>
<br>
Mind that with <code>CacheOnDisk</code> disabled, a change of the cache size has a major effect on memory usage.<br>
<br>
At the other hand, having the cache on disk results in a minimal memory requiement even for a huge cache size.<br>
But it comes at the extra time required for the disk operations and re-creation of memory structures after loading.<br>
<br>
<i>Note:<br>
1. This only affects the chain sync performance. Once the chain is synchronized, it does not matter.<br>
2. Monitor your node's TextUI for <code>cachempty: X</code> debugs. If X is not increasing after block 200000, don't bother with a bigger cache.<br>
3. The node does not need restarting to apply new values of these parameters.<br>
4. Restarting the node during chain sync discards the entire cache, even when on disk.</i><br>
<br>

<a name="wallet"></a>
<h2>Disable wallet functionality</h2>

You can disable node's wallet functionality, to save system memory used by a running client
and improve block processing times.<br>
In order to do so, use TextUI command <code>wallet off</code> or click the disable wallet button on the bottom of the <b>Wallet</b> page in the WebUI.<br>
<i>Note: This is only applicable to a synchronized node -
after it launched and made sure to have all the recent blocks.<br></i>
<br>

If you don't want the wallet functionality to automatically enable after the node is started and synchronized,
set the value of <code>AllBalances.AutoLoad</code> to <b>false</b> in the
<a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a>.<br>
<i>Note: You can manually enable wallet functionality at any time while the node is running,
either from WebUI or by executing TextUI command <code>wallet on</code>.</i><br>

<h2>External secp256k1 speedups</h2>

It is possible to use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/secp256k1">libsecp256k1</a>
(maintained by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/">Bitcoin Core</a> project)
that is written in C and assembler.<br>
<i>Note: To check the performance difference, use test programs from <code>gocoin/lib/others/cgo/ec_bench/</code>
 (e.g. <code>go run gonative.go</code> vs <code>go run sipasec.go</code>).</i><br>
<br>

To make Gocoin client to use the external library, copy either the file
<code>sipadll.go</code> (Windows only) or <code>sipasec.go</code> (any OS),
from <code>gocoin/client/speedups/</code> to its parent folder (<code>gocoin/client/</code>).
Then rebuild and restart the client.<br>
<i>Note: You can have either <code>sipadll.go</code> or <code>sipasec.go</code> in your
<code>gocoin/client/</code> folder, but never both of them as the client will not build then.</i><br>
<br>
Depending which speedup file you chose, follow either of the instructions in the table below.<br>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <td align="center" width="65%"><b>sipasec.go</b></td>
    <td align="center" width="35%"><b>sipadll.go</b> (Windows only)</td>

<tr>

<td valign="top">
In order to use <code>sipasec.go</code> speedup, build and install <b>secp256k1</b> library in your system.<br>
<br>
On Debian based Linux system, simply execute the following commands:<br>

<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt-get install gcc automake autoconf libtool make git libgmp-dev</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd bitcoin/src/secp256k1/</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;./autogen.sh</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;./configure</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;make</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo make install</code> <br>
<br>
<i>Note: When the library is properly installed, executing <code>go test</code> inside
<code>gocoin/lib/others/cgo/sipasec/</code> says <b>PASS</b>.</i>
</td>

<td valign="top">
To use <code>sipadll.go</code> speedup, you have to place <b>secp256k1.dll</b>
in <code>gocoin/client/</code> or in any folder where Windows looks for executables
(e.g. <code>C:\WINDOWS</code>).<br>
<br>
You can find <b>secp256k1.dll</b> in <code>gocoin/tools/sipa_dll/</code>
or you can download it from <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gocoin/files/?source=directory">sourceforge.net</a>
(it's inside <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gocoin/files/secp256k1.dll_v2-amd64.zip/download">secp256k1.dll_v2-amd64.zip</a>).<br>
<br>
To build <b>secp256k1.dll</b> youself, look into
<a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gocoin/files/secp256k1_win_v2.zip/download">secp256k1_win_v2.zip</a>.

<h2>Disable BlockDB compression</h2>
Edit the <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> and set the value of
<code>Memory.CompressBlockDB</code> to <b>false</b>.<br>
This may improve chain sync performance, as well as some tasks of a synchronized node.<br>
<br>
However, it will require more disk storage, as the compression saves about 15% of blocks data space.<br>
<br>

<a name="utxo-compr"></a>
<h2>Compress UTXO records</h2>
To save some system memory as well as a disk space, although at the cost of a performance, you can compress UTXO database.<br>
<br>
In order to do this, execute the tool <code>utxo -compress</code>.<br>
The tool needs to be executed from inside the data folder - where the <code>UTXO.db</code> file is.<br>
The node must not be running while executing the tool.<br>
<br>
You can reverse the operation of compressing the database, be running <code>utxo -decompress</code>.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: It saves only about 3% of space used by UTXO.db file.</i><br>
<br>

<a name="counters"></a>
<h2>Disable counters</h2>
Edit the <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> and set the value of <code>Stats.NoCounters</code> to <b>true</b>.<br>
This will turn off node's internal statistics which should improve performance.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: It is likely that such a performance gain will not be noticable.</i><br>
