2. Dependencies
After having MSYS2 and Mingw64 installed, you have to install dependency packages.
Just execute the following command from within the "MSYS2 MSYS" shell:

 > pacman -S make autoconf automake libtool lzip gmp

Now use "MSYS2 UCRT64" shell and execute:

 > cd ~
 > git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
 > cd bitcoin/src/secp256k1/
 > ./autogen.sh
 > ./configure
 > make
 > make install



If everything went well, you should see "PASS" executing "go test" in this folder.
Then copy "gocoin/client/speedups/sipasec.go" to "gocoin/client/" to boost your client.
